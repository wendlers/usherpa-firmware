This document describes how to flash the uSherpa firmware binary to yout microcontroller. 


Prerequisites
-------------

It is assumed, that the following is in place:

* A copy of the uSherpa firmware binary for your MCU (Launchpad with MSP430G2553)
* A TI Launchpad equipped with the MSP430G2553 connected to the USB 
  port of your PC, and the virtual COM port it is using is known.


Flashing the MSP430G2553 on a TI Launchpad
------------------------------------------

** On Linux

*** Using "mspdebug"

To perform this step, "mspdebug" tool is needed. On Ubuntu, the tool is available
as installable package. 

You should have downloaded the uSherpa firmware as a binary in ELF format.
We assume, that this firmware has the name "firmware.elf".

To flash the firmware to the Launchpad, make sure the Launchpad is connecetd and
download the firmware to the device by using "mspdebug":

  mspdebug rf2500 "prog firmware.elf"

After a short while, "mspdebug" should return with a success message. 


** On MacOSX

*** Using "mspdebug"

See the corresponding section under "On Linux". An easy to use toolchain installer
for the Launchpad could be found here: 

  http://code.google.com/p/osx-launchpad/


** On Windows

*** Using MSP430 Flasher

!!! WARNING !!!

Since I don't have Windows (don't need it), this is NOT tested. Pleas report success
or corrections if you successfully got this working.

!!! WARNING !!!

MSP430 Flasher is an open-source, shell-based interface for programming MSP430 devices
provided by TI. By using this utility, it is not needed to install any IDE (CCS, IAR, ...).

To use the utility, the USB dirvers for the Launchpad must be installed. You can get this
drivers here:

  https://github.com/energia/Energia/raw/gh-pages/files/EZ430-UART.zip

Next get the MSP430 Flasher and install it as described here:

  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_Flasher_-_Command_Line_Programmer

Next, download the uSherpa firmware as a binary in HEX format.
We assume, that this firmware has the name "firmware.hex".

To flash the firmware to the Launchpad, make sure the Launchpad is connected and
download the firmware to the device by using "MSP430Flasher":

  MSP430Flasher.exe -n MSP430G2553 -v -w firmware.hex

After a short while, "MSP430Flasher" should return with a success message.
